### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

 I'm David Justice, a Principal Software Engineer Lead in Microsoft's [Azure Container Upstream team](https://github.com/Azure/container-upstream). I lead teams focused on high performance Kubernetes cloud infrastructure, super itty bitty micro-virtual machines, and WebAssembly. I'm an active community member in both the Bytecode Alliance and the Cloud Native Computing Foundation where I work to bridge Wasm and Kubernetes. In my spare time, you will likely find me hacking here or working on [Go for DevOps](https://www.amazon.com/Go-DevOps-language-Kubernetes-Terraform/dp/1801818894).
